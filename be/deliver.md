# Ride-Hailing Offer Aggregator

## Project Breakdown

This document outlines a breakdown of tasks for the development of a Ride-Hailing Offer Aggregator.

### Backend Development Tasks

1. **Set Up Backend Framework**
   - Initialize a new project using NestJS.
   - Install necessary dependencies and set up a basic server structure.

2. **Define Mock Data Structure**
   - Design a JSON schema for mock data representing ride offers from different providers (e.g., Uber, Bolt).
   - Ensure the schema includes fields for provider name, price or price range, duration, and car type.

3. **Create Mock Data**
   - Generate sample data following the designed schema.
   - Include both fixed price and price range models for different providers.

4. **Develop REST Endpoint**
   - Implement an endpoint to aggregate and return the mock data.
   - Ensure no parameters are needed for this initial version.

5. **Data Normalization**
   - Write functions to normalize the mock data into a unified response format.
   - Standardize field names and value formats where necessary.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implement basic error handling for the REST endpoint.
   - Prepare notes on how error handling would evolve with the integration of real data and external APIs.

7. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for data normalization functions and the REST endpoint.
   - Ensure all tests pass and cover edge cases.

### Frontend Development Tasks

1. **Initialize Frontend Framework**
   - Set up a new Next.js project (or a React-based project).
   - Install necessary dependencies for UI development and API communication.

2. **Design UI Layout**
   - Sketch the layout for the single-page application.
   - Plan responsive design elements for different screen sizes.

3. **Develop UI Components**
   - Create React components for displaying ride options.
   - Implement a list view to show the aggregated ride offers.

4. **Implement Data Fetching**
   - Write a function to fetch data from the backend upon initial page load.
   - Handle loading and error states during data fetching.

5. **Format Ride Offer Display**
   - Uniformly format the display of each ride offer.
   - Include details such as provider, price, duration, and car type.

6. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and functions well on various devices.
   - Test on multiple screen sizes to check usability.

7. **User Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Implement user-friendly messages for scenarios like failed API calls or no available rides.
   - Include visual indicators or placeholders for empty states.

### Project Management and Collaboration

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting.
- **Task Tracking**: Utilize a project management tool (like Jira or Trello) to track progress on tasks.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Documentation and Delivery

- **Project Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation throughout the development process.
- **Final README**: Prepare a comprehensive README file detailing setup instructions, API response structure, and other relevant information.
